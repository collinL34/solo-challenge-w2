    <p class='p'> This website is well decigned because it works fast because of the way all the main images and sources for the css pages are linked to the actual html file. It also incorporates alot of simple but helful tags and makes well use of the div tag to help keep control of every different tag and also combine them too if you want them to be similair nad have the same characteristics as most of the tags in this website appear to do.</p>
